            <h3>Grid system for better Design User Interface</h3>
        </div>
        <img src="imgs/grid.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="show1">A grid system is a design tool used to arrange content on a webpage. it is a series
            of
            vertical and
            horizontal lines that create a matix of intersecting points which can be used to align and
            organize
            page elements. Grid system are used to create a consistent look and feel across a website, and
            can
            help to make the layout more visually appealing and easier to navigate</p>
        <p>If you've been to New York City and have walked the streets, it is easy to figure out how to get from one
            place to another because of the grid system that the city is built on. Just as the predictablity of a city
            grid helps locals and tourists get around easily, so do webpage grids provide a structure that guides users
            and designers alike. Because of their consistent reference point, grids improve page readibility and
            scannability and allow people to quikly get where they need to go</p>

            <h3 class="centre">Definition: A grid is made up of columns, gutters, and margins that provide a structure for
                the layout of
                elements on a page.</h3>

            <h3 class="centre">Definition: A grid is made up of columns, gutters, and margins that provide a structure for
                the layout of
                elements on a page.</h3>
            <p>There are three common grid types used in websites and interfaces: column grid, modular grid, and
                hierarchical grid.
            </p>
            <p>Column grid Involves dividing a page Into vertical columns. Ui elements and content are then aligned to these
                columns.</p>
            <p>Modular grid extends the column grid further by adding rows to it. This intersection of columns and rows make
                up modules to which elements and content are aligned. Modular grids are great for ecommerce and listing
                pages, as rows are repeatable to accommodate browsing.
            </p>
            <p>Hierarchical grid: Content is organized by limportance using columns, rows, and modules. The most Important
                elements and places of content take up the biggest pieces of the grid</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thirdpara">
            <h3>Breaking down the Grid</h3>
            <p>Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up of three elements: columns, gutters, and
                margins.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Columns:</strong>Columns take up most of the real estate in a grid. Elements and content are placed
                in columns. To ailapt to my screen size, column widths are generally defined with percentages rather than
                fhed values and the number of columns will vary. For example, a grid on a moblie device might have 4 columns
                and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.</p>
            <p><strong>Gutters:</strong>The gutter is the space between columns that separates elements and coritent from
                different columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change based on different breakpoints. For
                example,wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens, whenzes smaller gutters are appropriate for
                smaller screens like mobile.
            </p>
            <img src="imgs/Grid3img.png" alt="">
            <p class="centre">three elements make up any grid:(1) columns, (2) gutter, and (3) margins</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fourthpara">
            <h3>Examples of Grid in Uses</h3>
            <div class="Example1">
                <h4>Example 1: Hierarchical Grid</h4>
                <p>Our first example is from <u>The New York Times.</u> This screen utilizes a hierarchical grid to create a
                    newspaper-like meding experience. Al desktop screen size, two main columns make up the hierarchical
                    grid.
                    The most important news story takes up the most space in the grid, the left column, followed by
                    secondary
                    and tertiary stories, which take up the smaller column and modules on the right</p>
                <img src="imgs/Example1.png" alt="">
                <p class="center">The New York Times uses a hierarchical grid to achieve its newspaper-like reading
                    experience. (We
                    highlighted the columns in yellow, the gutters in blue, and the margins in purple.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Example2">
                <h3>Example 2: Column Grid</h3>
                <p>Our second example is from <u>Ritual.com</u>, a vitamin company. This design uses a column grid to create
                    an
                    attractive visual experience. At this screen size, four consistently sized columns make up the grid
                    structure and elements are aligned to and within these columns. The gutters, the spaces in between the
                    columns, are also consistently sized and help the user visually separate the different products. The
                    margins are independently sized and are the same between the left and right sides.</p>
                <img src="imgs/Example2.png" alt="">
                <p>Ritual’s four-column grid makes scanning products easy. (We highlighted the columns in yellow, the
                    gutters in blue, and the margins in purple.)</p>
                <div class="Example3">
                    <h3>Example 3: Modular Grid</h3>
                    <p>Our third example is from <u>Behance</u>, a design library. The site’s design uses a modular grid to
                        create
                        a pleasant browsing experience. At desktop size, rows are made up of 4 consistently sized modules.
                        Horizontal gutters are slightly thicker than vertical gutters and the margins are consistently sized
                        on the left and right of the design. Like in previous example, the gutters visually separate each
                        element.</p>
                    <img src="imgs/Example3.png" alt="">
                    <p>Behance's design uses a modular grid, which allows users to easily browse. (We highlighted the
                        columns in yellow, the gutters in blue, and the margins in purple.)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="Example4"></div>
                <h3>Example 4: Breaking the Grid</h3>
                <p>Our last example is <u>Shrine from Google's Material Studies</u>. This design uses a column grid, as we
                    can see based on the left navigation, which is 2 columns wide. Look closely and you will see that some
                    product images settle to the margins, while others do not. Breaking the grid like this makes it
                    challenging to focus or quickly scan product images and calls more attention to some products over
                    others. It is okay to break the grid every so often, as long as you have a valid reason for it.</p>
                <img src="imgs/Example4.png" alt="">
                <p>Breaking the grid produces a chaotic browsing experience for users. (We highlighted the columns in
                    yellow, the gutters in blue, and the margins in purple.)</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="fifthpara Benefits">
            <h3>Benefits of the Grid </h3>
            <p>Using a grid benefits both end users and the designers alike:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Designers can quickly put together well-aligned interfaces.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Users can easily scan predictable grid-based interfaces.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A good grid is easy to adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. In fact, grid layouts are an
                        essential component of <u>responsive web design.</u> Responsive design uses breakpoints to determine
                        the screen size threshold at which the layout should change. For example, a desktop screen may have
                        12 grid columns, which may be stacked on mobile so that the resulting layout has only 4 columns.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="imgs/Benefit.png" alt="">
            <p class="centre">At the mobile size, Behance’s one-column grid (left) was reflowed into a four-column grid
                structure (right).</p>
            <p>Even more importantly, the grid is not a throw-away concept. It is used by both designers and developers
                alike. Be sure to communicate with your developers the grid structure used when creating the design, so they
                can implement it accordingly.</p>

        <div class="sixthpara">
            <h3>Choosing and Setting Up Your Grid</h3>
            <p>How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your
                user.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Choose the right grid for your needs.</strong> Take time to think through what type of grid ­—
                column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one
                item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical
                grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider
                using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. For example,
                elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Spend time setting up your grid.</strong> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well
                for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes
                relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
                A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of
                columns will decrease as your device size decreases. Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and
                easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.
            </p>
            <img src="imgs/grids-in-figma-94.png" alt="">
            <p class="centre">Easily set the number of columns, the gutter size, and margin size in Figma.</p>
            <p><strong>Always place content within columns, not gutters.</strong>The gutters should remain empty as you
                place elements on the grid in order to clearly separate and align content and elements.</p>
            <img src="imgs/content-not-in-gutters-95.png" alt="">
            <p class="centre">Content or elements should be placed within and across columns, not gutters.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Consider using an 8px grid system.</strong>For most common devices, the screen size in pixels is a
                multiple of 8. Keeping grid-component values at a multiple of 8 will generally make it easier to scale and
                implement a grid.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Grids not only provide designers a structure on which to base layouts, but they also improve readability and
                scannability for end users. Use a good grid system that easily adapts to various screen sizes.</p>
